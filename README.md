# PixXxeL
A game entirely written in x86 asm.

Visualize with tab size set to 4.

# Run

This is coded in a binary format only recognized by Windows up to Windows XP, so you need an emulator. Fortunately, DOSBox works perfectly and all you need to do is:

```bash
dosbox pixel.com
```

# Recompile / reassemble

This program is written in MASM 8086 assembly. You need a MASM-compatible assembler to "recompile" (assemble) it, and this is quite difficult to find nowadays, at least on linux. I tested jwasm, but it did not produce a usable executable.

The project was originally assembled with RadAsm on Windows.
