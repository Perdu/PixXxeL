# Recompile / reassemble

This program is written in MASM 8086 assembly. You need a MASM-compatible assembler to "recompile" (assemble) it, which is quite difficult to find nowadays.

The project was originally assembled with RadAsm on Windows.

It seems difficult to recompile it nowadays, at least on linux. I tested jwasm, but it did not produce a usable executable.
